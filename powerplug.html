                    <h3>Menstrual Cycle: Basics</h3>
                    <p>A menstrual cycle is measured from the first day of your period to the day before your next period.</p>
                    <p>The average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days, but everyone's cycle is different. For example, teenagers might have cycles that last 45 days, whereas people in their 20s to 30s might have cycles that last 21 to 38 days.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: Cycle length and period length are 2 different things.</p>
                    <p>The menstrual cycle has 4 phases:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Menstrual Phase: This is when women have a period. The uterus lining sheds and flows out of the vagina. The period contains blood, mucus and some cells from the lining of the uterus. The average length of a period is 3 to 7 days.</li>
                        <li>Follicular phase: This phase starts on the first day of the period and lasts for 13 to 14 days. Changing hormone levels cause the lining of the uterus to thicken and follicles to grow on the surface of the ovaries. Usually only one follicle will mature into an egg.</li>
                        <li>Ovulation phase: This is when a mature egg is released from an ovary. This usually happens once a month, about 2 weeks before the next period. This is also the time when the chances of getting pregnant are the highest.</li>
                        <li>Luteal phase: In this phase, the egg travels through the fallopian tubes to the uterus. The uterus lining continues to thicken in preparation for pregnancy. In case one gets pregnant, they won't have a period, otherwise they will have a period and the menstrual cycle will start over again. (14 days)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>App Onboarding</h3>
                    <p>Users are prompted to integrate and import their cycle data from a third party app (if any), input their primary goal for using this powerplug, period length, cycle regularity, cycle length, period dates, health conditions (if any) and any birth control used in the last 6 months.</p>

                    <h3>Integrations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We only import period start and end dates from the integrated apps.</li>
                        <li>As soon as the user integrates the two apps, the data should sync immediately.</li>
                        <li>For the users facing issues logging in their Clue app, flag the cases to Terra on this thread.</li>
                        <li>Once the cycle data has been imported into UH from the integrated apps, further changes to the data on the third party app won't change the data in UH. Also, any changes made to the data by the user on UH won't be written back to the integrated app.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Cycle tracking: Tracking for basic cycle health</h3>
                    <h4>Input parameters:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>period_ranges: A list of period ranges, each containing: Start date of a period, End date of the same period</li>
                        <li>last_cycle_length: Integer representing the length of the most recent cycle (for irregular cycles)</li>
                        <li>typical_cycle_length: Integer representing the typical cycle length (for regular cycles)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>How algo works:</h4>
                    <p>Take last cycle_start_date > Add typical_cycle_length (for regular cycles) or last_cycle_length (for irregular cycles) to it > You get predicted_cycle_start_date of the next cycle > Take difference of last cycle_end_date and cycle_start_date to get cycle duration > Add to predicted_cycle_start_date to get predicted_cycle_end_date</p>
                    <p>NOTE: Current algo assumes future cycles will resemble past cycles and doesn't account for external factors that might affect the cycles (like stress, medication, health conditions, etc)</p>
                    <h4>At any given time, the user would have to be in one of the 6 states:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Menstrual phase: When the user is in their logged menstrual stage (banner shows period start and calculated end dates)</li>
                        <li>Follicular phase: The phase between menstrual and ovulation phases (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Ovulation phase: When the user is in their ovulation phase (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Luteal phase: Phase between ovulation and predicted menstrual phase dates (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Predicted menstrual phase: Menstrual dates predicted by the algo (banner shows the current predicted dates)</li>
                        <li>Unconfirmed phase: If user hasn't logged their periods even after 7 days have passed past the predicted menstrual phase dates (no banner shown)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>NOTE: At the moment there's a bug in the algo whereby the user's max cycle length gets capped to 30 days once they start using the PP. This isn't an issue for the regular cyclers but for irregular ones, this can result in app showing unconfirmed phase until they log in their next cycle dates.</p>
                    <h4>The powerplug remains 'in calibration' mode until the following criterias are met:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>At least 3 cycle start dates</li>
                        <li>At least 50% biomarker data for those cycles</li>
                        <li>BMI ≤28, age is ≤ 40</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Tracking to get pregnant</h3>
                    <h4>Definitions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fertile window: 5 days before ovulation day, ovulation day and one day after ovulation day. So, 7 days in total.</li>
                        <li>Outside fertile window: Any day that's outside the above defined fertile window duration.</li>
                        <li>Approaching fertile window: The day after the period ends up until the start of the fertile window.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>How algo works:</h4>
                    <p>Divided into 3 phases:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Phase 1: From start of menses upto <40% of cycle duration. Uses past data (cycle start date+biomarkers) to predict fertile window</li>
                        <li>Phase 2: Fertile window (>40% to 70% of cycle duration+5 days) Biomarker algo kicks in and predicts new fertile window (only if enough biomarker data is present)</li>
                        <li>Phase 3: From 5 days past 70% of cycle duration up until the next period start date Uses past data to calculate next fertile window</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The predicted ovulation window is determined by anchoring to your period start date and detecting a biosignature pattern from your temperature, resting heart rate (RHR), and heart rate variability (HRV). As the cycle advances, additional data improves the algorithm's accuracy in detecting the biosignature. This can sometimes shift the predicted ovulation window, especially because we're forecasting the window in real-time, during the cycle itself.</p>
                    <p>NOTE (1): Even 1 day of inaccurate data can affect C&O forecasts. However, we use a 3 day rolling window for data prediction, hence, the user will start seeing major shifts in their fertile window predictions if the data remains inaccurate for 3 days continuously.</p>
                    <p>NOTE(2): The temperature deviation shown in the powerplug tile is different from the skin temperature deviation captured on the home page of the app. This is because we use a 30 day rolling baseline for the calculation of temp deviation for C&O powerplug.</p>

                    <h4>Cycle Tracking Configs Dashboard:</h4>
                    <p>This dashboard gives all the details filled by the user while onboarding into their Cycle & Ovulation Powerplug</p>
                    <h4>Menstrual Cycles Dashboard:</h4>
                    <p>This dashboard shows all of the cycles and their data tracked by the user along with the predicted cycle dates computed by our algorithm.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: We use this dashboard only to check cycle data and other onboarding details filled by the user. This is intended to give a complete overview of the data being shown to the user on their app.</p>

                    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                    <p>NOTE: To troubleshoot any technical issue with the user's powerplug, updating their ring's firmware, resets or making them re-onboard the powerplug is not going to help. We would have to flag it to the tech team.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User feels their ovulation dates predicted by the app aren't correct: Troubleshooting: Currently its not possible to input/log/correct ovulation day that is predicted by the system. But this is an enhancement planned in the next version for April.</li>
                        <li>Users complain that their predicted period days aren't correct: Troubleshooting: They can always "log" their period by tapping the calendar icon on the top right next to the edit cycle details button and we'll revise that to recalculate their phases.</li>
                        <li>The user feels there are days where their temperature has not been recorded (in cycle tracking): When deviation from the recorded baseline is very close to 0, there are no bars shown on the graph. We're working on improvements to the feature so that this is clear going forward. (Currently may also show as "- -" on a given day, on the app)</li>
                        <li>Users complain that they are seeing the 'in calibration' banner even after logging in past 3 cycles data and wearing the ring continuously: Troubleshooting: We show the "In calibration" if we can't come up with a fertility high confidence. This high confidence is decided on some factors as described.</li>
                        <li>User notices that predicted ovulation window changes on a given day: We predict the ovulation window for a user based on 3 biomarkers (temperature deviation, RHR and HRV) - hence, if on any day we find that these biomarkers are more (or less) suggestive towards a certain day, the algorithm will change basis the stronger suggestive biomarker pattern. Hence, the predicted ovulation window may dynamically change.</li>
                        <li>Users complain that the temperature being shown in their sleep index section and the one being shown inside the powerplug are different: Troubleshooting: For the temperature you see on the Sleep Index details page, we calculate it by excluding nap sleep. This gives you an average skin temperature during your main sleep period, without naps affecting the value. However, the skin temperature in the Cycle Tracking details page is pulled from your baseline temperature, which includes all temp data within sleep boundaries—naps included. Hence, the difference.</li>

                        <li>Handling non bleeding users</li>
                        <li>Non-bleeding users: "Amenorrhea," or the absence of menstruation, can be normal during certain periods like before puberty, during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or after menopause, but can also be a sign of various medical conditions or lifestyle factors.</li>
                        <li>SPOTTING: Spotting refers to light vaginal bleeding that occurs outside of your regular menstrual period. Spotting can have various causes, including hormonal fluctuations, ovulation, birth control methods, pregnancy (implantation bleeding), or even certain medical conditions. Spotting is lighter and less prolonged than a regular period, and it usually doesn't require the use of pads or tampons.</li>
                        <li>Make provision to input LH result</li>
